        content: |
          Illustration of swarm intelligence through a flocking example utilizing coherent emergent behavior (flocking) of a swarm, when each agent is 
            - Attracted to other agents 
            - Repulsed when too close to other agents
            - Performing velocity alignment with other agents 
            
          Examination of this behavior in 2D; the swarm will be composed of N agents; each agent will be defined by its position (p) and velocity (v).
